Python Data Structure

## Arrays
an array is a collection of elements identified by index or a key.

## Linked list
Consist of nodes where each node contains a data element and a reference to the next node in the sequence
Types  of linked list 
- Single linked list: Navigation is forward only 
- Doubly linked list: forward and backward navigation is possible
- Circular linked list: Last element is linked to the first element 

A **single linked list** is made up of nodes that consist of two parts:
- Data -> Contains the data
- Link -> Contains the address of the next node of the list 

The way that this is work is the following:
- Giving a list of numbers with a lenght that can vary, we have the number whit the position of where that number is 
- we create our node where its going to be compose of the data, and the link, that the link is the position of the next number in the list
- we are going to do that until we reach the end of the list and we dont have any other values to unpack 
- The other thing you must have on mind is the pointer, the pointer is going to indicate where the first number is going to be located so we can track the first number and acces it 


## Stack
Stack is a linear data structure that follows the last-in-first-out (LIFO) principle, where the last element inserted is the first one to be removed, operations include push, pop and peek

## Queues 
Queues is a linear data structure asdhering to the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) protocol, where the first element is going to be the first one elimiinated
